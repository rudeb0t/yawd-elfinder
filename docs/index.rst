yawd-elfinder django application documentation
==============================================

`elFinder`_ is a jQuery web file manager providing standard features -such as 
uploading, moving, renaming files etc-, as well as a set of advanced features
such as image resizing/cropping/rotation and archive file creation.

**yawd-elfinder** provides a fully-featured python/django implementation 
for the elfinder connector v.2. A custom Model Field (tied to a nice 
form widget) is also provided. Therefore, you can easily manage your local
and remote files through the Django admin interface, assign them to model 
fields and access the file URLs in your Django templates.
